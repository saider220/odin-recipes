      <div class="ingriedients">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
          <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
          <li>
            ½ teaspoon salt-free garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs.
            Dash)
          </li>
          <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
          <li>1 (3 pound) turkey breast with skin</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon minced shallot</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
          <li>1 splash dry white wine</li>
          <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons half-and-half (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="directions">
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Mix 1/4 cup butter, garlic, paprika, Italian seasoning, garlic and
            herb seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place turkey breast with skin-side up into a roasting pan. Loosen
            skin with your fingers; brush 1/2 of the butter mixture over the
            turkey breast and underneath the skin. Reserve remaining butter
            mixture. Tent turkey breast loosely with aluminum foil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour; baste turkey breast with
            remaining butter mixture. Return to oven and roast until the juices
            run clear and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the
            thickest part of the breast, not touching bone, reads 165 degrees F
            (65 degrees C), about 30 more minutes. Let turkey breast rest 10 to
            15 minutes before serving.
          </li>
          <li>
            While turkey is resting, transfer pan drippings to a skillet. Skim
            off excess grease, leaving about 1 tablespoon in skillet. Place
            skillet over low heat; cook and stir shallot in turkey grease until
            opaque, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt 1 tablespoon butter in skillet with shallot and whisk in white
            wine, scraping any browned bits of food from skillet. Whisk in
            chicken stock and flour until smooth. Bring to a simmer, whisking
            constantly, until thickened. For a creamier, lighter gravy, whisk in
            half-and-half.
          </li>
        </ol>
